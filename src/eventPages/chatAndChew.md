Expect the unexpected at Chef’s Kitchen. After February 22, they’ll be changing the blank space from Italian to Chef Christian’s new creative, seasonal menu. Any guesses? Be among the first to sample the new culinary creations this team is dreaming up when you come meet up with us on Thursday, March 12. We’ll be there at 6 pm, so join us for a drink and appetizers or stay for dinner.

### This is a free event, but attendees will need to purchase their own food and drinks. We ask you to please register so we have a head count. Thanks!
